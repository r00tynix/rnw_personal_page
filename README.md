# rnw_personal_page
Welcome to my corner of the internet.

This repo exists for one simple reason:  
I forget things… so I write them down.

Sometimes it’s notes.  
Sometimes it’s links.  
Sometimes it’s things I *definitely* thought I’d remember later (spoiler: I didn’t).

## About Me

**r00tynix**  
Cybersecurity enthusiast | curious by nature | breaks things to understand them

I spend a lot of time learning, testing, and poking at technology to see how it behaves when you ask it the wrong questions.

## What You’ll Find Here

- Random notes  
- Public links  
- Small experiments  
- Stuff that didn’t fit anywhere else  

Nothing fancy. Nothing secret. Just… public space.

## Elsewhere on the Internet

I tend to reuse the same handle.  
Old habit. Hard to break.

If you’re looking for more:
- I share short thoughts and updates on other platforms like Instagram,LinkedIn,X,Youtube
- Code lives here, words live elsewhere
